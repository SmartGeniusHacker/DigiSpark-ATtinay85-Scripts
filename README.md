# DigiSpark-ATtinay85-Scripts
This is a set of hand-written DigiSpark sketches for the Arduino IDE that utilize the DigiKeyboard.h library making the DigiSpark to act as a keyboard and execute a variety of actions. 

# Instructions
Configure the Arduino IDE for the DigiSpark using: https://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/connecting or Seytonic's tutorial: https://youtu.be/fGmGBa-4cYQ or if you want tutorail in hindi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlIHg8nh0iY. Then download one of scripts (sketches), open them with Arduino IDE, modify them if needed and upload them to the DigiSpark.
